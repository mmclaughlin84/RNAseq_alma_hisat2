If sequencing carried out by TPU, have files transfered to **SHARED** folder on RDS move to correct location.
If using genewiz download files by connecting to sftp and enter password, this may require two attempts for unknown reasons.
`sftp <user_name>@gweusftp.brooks.com`

List the files, or navigate about to check directory structure.
`ls -lh`
`cd <directory_name>`

Set ‘local directory’, ie where on your computer to download the folder to
`lcd /Volumes/DATA/DRI/URTHY/TARGTHER/<user_name>/`
